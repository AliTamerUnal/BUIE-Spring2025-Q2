# BUIE-Spring2025-Q2

1. Write a recursive python function called `get_permutations` that, given an input string, returns the list of all strings that can be obtained as permutations of characters of the given string. Write the code to a file named `getpermutations.py`.
2. Write a `pytest` test to make sure that input `'abc'` returns `['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']`.
3. Write and explain the time complexity of function `get_permutations` in a file named `q2.q3.txt`.
